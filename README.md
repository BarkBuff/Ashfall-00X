### *"The failure was expected. The system was ready."*

## STATUS: CLASSIFIED / NOT YET ACTIVATED

> You’ve found something that’s not supposed to be live.  
> The system hasn’t booted.  
> The first trace route hasn’t pulsed.  
> Nothing here is operational — **yet**.

## Codename: ASHFALL‑00X  
> *Resilient Embedded Mesh Protocol — based on the unreleased OBLIVION‑CORE substrate.*

This isn’t a library.  
This isn’t a dev board.  
This is the first *known attempt* to create a **self-recovering microcontroller mesh** — designed for conditions where traditional systems fail, catch fire, or fall silent.

## The Problem

All embedded systems are built with a lie:  
**That nothing will fail.**

They rely on one chip. One brain. One heartbeat.  
When it dies, so does everything it controlled.

---

## The Intent

**ASHFALL‑00X** was conceived to solve one thing:

> **How do you keep going when everything breaks?**

We’re engineering a *low-power neural mesh* of microcontrollers that:

- Discover each other on boot
- Negotiate real-time roles
- Share and reassign computational tasks
- Detect dead nodes and reroute logic
- Store OTA payloads and state backups

All **without an RTOS.**  
All **without mercy for failure.**

---

## Project Status

> There is no hardware.  
> There is no firmware.  
> Only fragments of a backplane, scattered schematics, and a ghost protocol with no implementation.

The system has not yet come online.  
We don't know what will happen when it does.
